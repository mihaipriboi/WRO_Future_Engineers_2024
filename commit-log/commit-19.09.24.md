## Continued developing the solution

We fixed different corner cases, made sure we always avoid the parking spot and refactored the code a bit. We also made the color detection more robust by enforcing a minimum cube blob height and thought about implementing an easy check to differentiate between orange lines and close red cubes by testing whether the cube blob center is inside the line blob or the other way around.
