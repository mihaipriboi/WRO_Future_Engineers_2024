## Modified the strategy

We modified our approach: instead of focusing on a wall centered solution in which our turns depended on the wall size as seen by the camera, we take turns based on the corner lines. In addition, we made our cube avoidance algorithm more agile and more robust, now having a single code that can solve both rounds.
