## Added new electrical diagram and new code

Improved the robustness of the code and modified the electrical diagram since we don't power up the camera through the battery input anymore, but by using the VIN and GND pins since it's more stable this way. The reason is that we didn't find the perfect port, so we made one ourselves, but with time it got less and less stable. Therefore, using the VIN and GND pins provides the best grip ever.
