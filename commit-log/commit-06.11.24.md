## Continued working on the parking

This commit contains untested code that implements a more stable and accurate approach to driving close to the outside walls and that represents the starting work for the parking wall detection. In addition we need to find a new approach to driving close to the outside walls since from the point where we stopped we may encounter a cube that goes unobserved, therefore leading to a possible collision.
