## Implemented the final turn and started working on the parking

For now, our parking approach is quite simple: we'll basically implement the quali approach, but we'll try to stay as close to the outer wall as possible in order to be positioned for the parking. When we see the magenta walls, we'll have a hardcoded sequence of moves that puts us in the parking spot.
